# Cyanide
Backdoor intended for Minecraft Servers

Cyanide is a plugin that was originally created for private use, then I picked back up on it, I tried to sell it but it was a huge flop coming in at 0 sales, so I decided to go
open-source.

The source that I uploaded is just 2 classes, and I will not help you get this source working, however, I am working on a new backdoor that will be fully released,
and updated for the average consumer.

Use Cyanide at your own risk! I do not take responsibility if you get banned from any minecraft servers!

Most importantly of all, do not steal my code and share it as your own, you didnt write this shit dumbass, I did, you're free to use it just don't be a fucking dumbass ok?

If you ask me for help compiling this source, I will NOT help you! it should be fairly straightforward.

Farewell~
